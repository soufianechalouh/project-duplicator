You have a template project (data pipeline, scrapper ...), and you're copy-pasting it whenever you want to create a similar one. You then have to change the parameters everywhere. This piece of software will let you do it fast.

Disclaimer:
Yes, I know config.py files are made to ease the use of global parameters. This project is just meant to get me started on my coding challenge.
